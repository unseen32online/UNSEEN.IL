<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack e-commerce frontend for the UNSEEN clothing brand, moving from initial design choices to a fully styled and content-rich application. The work started with an elegant minimalist design, which evolved into a dark theme with bold fonts per user requests. The core functionality, including product display, shopping cart, and basic navigation, was built using mock data. Significant effort was put into styling, content integration (philosophy, contact, privacy policy), and adding specific products with images. The conversation recently shifted from frontend design to critical backend functionality, specifically payment processing (HYP integration) and a comprehensive order management system, which the user has now explicitly requested to be built.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an e-commerce website for UNSEEN, a casual/daily clothing brand. Initially, the design was elegant minimalist but evolved to a dark theme with bold fonts, zero border radius, gold accents, and specific font choices (Bebas Neue, Montserrat). The website needs a full shopping experience, starting with mock data. Required pages/sections include a homepage (hero, collections, philosophy, newsletter, Instagram banner), collection pages (Tops, Shorts/Pants), product detail pages, a shopping cart, checkout, Privacy Policy, and Contact Us. Products (t-shirts, shorts) must be added with names, prices (₪), sizes (S-XXL), colors, descriptions, and multiple images. The site should display product images in collections and cart.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was discussing backend functionality with the user. The frontend of the UNSEEN website is fully developed, styled, and populated with mock data. It features a dark theme with bold typography, a large centered logo, and responsive design. Key pages like Home, Collection (Tops, Shorts), Product Detail, Cart, Checkout, Contact Us, and Privacy Policy are all implemented. Five unique t-shirt products and one shorts product are listed in  with images, prices in ₪, and detailed descriptions. An Instagram banner has been added to the homepage, and the cart now displays product images. The user inquired about payment processing and order management, and, after a detailed explanation of options, explicitly requested to build for me full backend system. The engineer confirmed this and was about to begin implementing the core backend infrastructure for order management.
